                        We’re always thinking about how to manufacture the products we design – it’s second nature. And our in-house manufacturing capabilities can bring your product to life. Where possible we manufacture prototypes in house, and once the design is signed off, we can also manage the entire manufacturing process and supply chain for you. Our manufacturing services include: prototype manufacturing; small batch manufacturing; supply chain management; manufacturing lifecycle management.
